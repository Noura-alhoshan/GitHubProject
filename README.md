# GitHubProject
Main Features
• Display a list of users from GitHub APIs, with some details (username, avatar, number of public repositories, and followers)
• Display a list of repositories for the selected user (repository name, description, and  License)
• Show all users that are forked selected repository.

Architecture
• We would like you to use the MVVM architecture or an iteration of MVVM. Try to solve the problem of mixing business and presentation logic in the View Model.
• The project should be very easy to unit test, and should have at least five unit tests.
• Feel free to choose the Observer mechanism.
• Support error scenarios by simply showing an alert view.


Guidelines
• Be expressive, write code as you speak, and be optimally verbose.
• The app should cache the images so they’re available when the app is offline
• The app should show loading indicators when the feed is loading
• Use Auto Layout when possible. Please decide between Xib vs. Storyboards, we would love
to know your opinion on that one.
• Use URLSession with Codable protocol.
• The app should be optimized for memory and network usage.
